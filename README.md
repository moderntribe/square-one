>[!NOTICE]
># SquareOne Deprecated
>
>**We are no longer maintaining or making updates to this codebase.** SquareOne served us well for many years. However, it doesn't play particularly well with WordPress development architecture and best practices utilizing the Block & Site Editors.
>
> We've been building with the Block Editor for several years now and have developed a new, lightweight framework for WordPress development we affectionately call _[Moose](https://github.com/moderntribe/moose/)_. Moose is designed to take advantage of all the latest features in WordPress.

SquareOne is a development framework lovingly maintained by Modern Tribe used for WordPress projects. It augments WordPress into a modern application framework. We think it's pretty neat.
