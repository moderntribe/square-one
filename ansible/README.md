# Ansible Provisioning, Configuration, and Deployment

## Requirements

* Ansible >= 2.1.1

There are some other requirements if you're actually provisioning/configuring the servers with Ansible, but if you're just deploying, installing Ansible should cover you.

After installing ansible you should run `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -c` from this directory

## Security of Keys and Configuration
Some variables and files used by Ansible contain sensitive data, so we're using a tool called [Ansible Vault](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html) to encrypt the data in place.  To work with this data, you'll need to have the vault key.  You can find the vault key in your project's 1Password vault. When you have it, run the following command from this directory: `echo "[the key]" >> .vaultpass`.

Once you do that, you'll need to decrypt the necessary resources manually:

```
ansible-vault decrypt .aws/WHATEVER.pem.vaulted --output=.aws/WHATEVER.pem
```

The rest of the decryption will be handled during Ansible Playbook execution.

## Deployments

For info on deployments, check out our [Ansible docs for deployments](/docs/ansible/deploys.md).

## Tips

Avoid putting tasks directly in playbooks. Instead, find an appropriate role (or make a new one) to contain the tasks.

## Notes

The `local-config.php` file that gets used comes from the `roles/wordpress/templates` directory.
