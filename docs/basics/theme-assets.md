# Theme Assets

## Images

Images for the themes live in a folder named "img" at `/wp-content/themes/core/img/theme`.
 
Use the `Image` component to render an image from the theme or a user-uploaded image.

## Fonts

The build system has built-in support for Google & Adobe (Typekit) webfont CSS files. An
additional custom CSS file URL may also be used.

Check `\Tribe\Project\Theme\Theme_Definer` on how to add your self-hosted,
Google or Adobe (Typekit) fonts.

## Icons

Icons for the system are powered by an icomoon generated kit, or by inline svg
using [postcss-inline-svg](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-inline-svg).

For the icomoon kit that powers the core theme, you will find the files generated by this
system at `wp-content/themes/core/assets/library/theme/icons/core`.

For accessible usage of font icons [see here](http://fontawesome.io/accessibility/).

### How to Add Icons to Core Theme

* Go to [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects)
* Create a new project. 
* Select import icons from top nav
* Import the `selection.json` in the dev folder
* Add your new icons to the kit
* Generate fonts using the settings from last round
* paste the zip file (it must be named core-icons.zip) in the root of the wp-content/themes/core/assets/library directory.
* Run `gulp icons` in the theme directory
* Your _icons pcss and variables files will be auto generated for you and the fonts/kit directories updated, then theme css will be rebuilt
