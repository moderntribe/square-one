# Build Process

## Quick Start

1. Install global build tools
   1. nvm
   1. yarn
   1. gulp-cli
1. Build frontend assets
   1. `nvm use`
   1. `yarn install:theme`
   1. `gulp dist`
1. Install backend dependencies
   1. `so composer install`

## Building Frontend Assets

### Node

This system uses npm for dependency management for front end assets.

To find out which version you should be using, check the .nvmrc file at root. We recommend
the version manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your node versions.

With that installed you can just `nvm use` in the root of this folder before beginning dev
tasks that involve node and it will put you on the correct version, after it has been installed
by you initially.

To install your dependencies it is recommended you use Yarn, a global cli tool you install that
fetches deps from npm, bower or other repos. First install globally in your currently required
version of node if not already in place: [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Then simply `yarn install` in the root of this project.

### Gulp

This system uses gulp to run tasks. Make sure you have installed `node_modules` at root or theme with `yarn install:theme` using the correct version of node for the project (check the .nvmrc file at root to determine that and check the [node guide](/docs/build/node.md) here for details).

If you don't already have the [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed globally on that node version do so.

If you have gulp installed globally as well, use this projects gulp version when running tasks by using `./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js` instead of `gulp`

During dev you have 2 choices for gulp tasks to run when editing any pcss or javascript files.

* `gulp watch` will watch pcss and js for changes
* `yarn dev` will watch pcss and js for changes and launch [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/). It will proxy through the dev url you can define in `local-config.json` at root. Check the local-config-sample.json for more information. Also set your path to the certs you generated for your docker domain.

Before you push code back upstream, you must run `yarn validate`. This will lint your js and css. If you code does not lint please correct the issues then run again before pushing upstream.

You should also run `yarn dist` when you pull new work, to make sure you have built the latest files from other peoples work.


## Installing PHP dependencies

### Composer
We use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to maintain PHP dependencies. This allows us to **not** version
control stuff that is already version controlled elsewhere.

### Composer in Docker
Traditionally, composer projects use the native `composer` command (e.g. `composer install`,
`composer update`). Because SquareOne operates in Docker containers, we cannot rely on composer
to behave appropriately in all environments because *composer runs on the host machine, and not
in the docker container that has all the expected system requirements such as the appropriate PHP version.*

As such, SquareOne Global provides the `so composer` command that mirrors the native `composer` command.
The only difference is that it runs *inside* the docker php-fpm container.

### Setting Up SquareOne
When you initially start your docker containers using the
`so start` command, composer will look for a `composer/auth.json` file
in your `dev/docker` directory. This is a specially formatted JSON file used to authenticate
against Github for private repo access. If it doesn't exist, you will be prompted to visit
a URL on Github that will grant an oAuth token. Copy this token and paste it onto the command
line at the prompt, which will then create the `auth.json` file.

After the containers launch, the `so start` command will automatically also run
`composer install` and setup SquareOne. However, there may be times where, say, a version of
WordPress needs to be bumped or a plugin needs updating. Make the change in `composer.json`
and run `so composer update`. This will download the updated packages and install
in place. It will also upddate the `composer.lock` file which should be committed.
