# Gravity Forms JavaScript

We have a simple JavaScript module for forms that handles auto-scroll and form submission located here: `wp-content/themes/core/js/src/theme/modules/forms.js`.
This should work just fine without any customizations needed, but any Gravity Forms-specific JavaScript that needs to be added
should be done in this module.
