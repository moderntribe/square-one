# Overview 

This system will use a plugin by Modern Tribe called Panel Builder for the majority if its content control. Panel Builder has fairly detailed developer orientated documentation `/wp-content/plugins/panel-builder/readme.md` (Updates in progress)

A Panel is a completely self-contained piece of content defined by the core plugin.
It has its own template and its own data. The core plugin defines what fields it
will have in the admin, and the theme controls how those fields will display
on the front end.

Read below for basic Panels registration, usage, themeing and configuration as it applies to this project.
