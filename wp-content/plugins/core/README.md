#  === [1] Back End ===


Welcome to [1]! The core plugin will be where the majority of back end development takes place.  This is a living document so you may check the square-one repository for any new information if you are joining this project after inception.


##  === Ground Rules ===


* Let's start with the easiest first: write good, clean, well structured and commented code!
* Be nice and comment your code. You should get a good idea of guidelines for doing so within the various files and languages in [1].
* If you have questions about anything at all always ask!
* Do your best to stick to the conventions and rules laid out in [1], and if you have ideas to improve upon [1] let us know.
